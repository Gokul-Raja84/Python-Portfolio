- The code uses the turtle module to create a Pong game with two paddles and a bouncing ball.

- The players control the paddles using the keyboard, with one player using the "w" and "s" keys and the other player using the up and down arrow keys.

- The ball moves at a constant speed and bounces off the paddles and the game window borders and you can adjust the ball speed.

- The scores for each player are displayed on the screen using a pen object.

- The game ends when one of the players reaches a predefined score limit.

- The code allows for customization by adjusting parameters such as the score limit, ball speed, paddle size, and colors. Also, the background image too.

- Additional features can be added, such as sound effects or an AI opponent. If you can, customize it as per your requirements.

- This code provides a basic framework for a Pong game and can be expanded upon to create a more advanced and personalized game.
